# Ruby Refresher Test

## Summary

This was our Week 7 challenge at Makers Academy, a "Ruby Refresher" test in preparation for learning Rails. The test comprised 41 questions, all but two of which had a corresponding RSpec test that needed to be passed. The focus of the test was to answer the questions in an elegant and concise way, using the most appropriate methods. It was a really good way of revising Ruby methods and even learning some new ones, as well as getting more familiar with the Ruby documentation.
